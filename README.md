## Project Description
Who hasn't played hangman? The original game is a paper an pencil one, but here we are to bring it to the next level using Python. 

## Rules
In this version, you choose the difficulty level. Then, based on the choice, the computer thinks of a word and you try to guess it by suggesting letters with a certain amount of tries. Of course, the illustration is also there to add a bit more of pressure. Wouldn't you want to leave that poor man on his own, would you?

## Workflow
1. Creating the [Github project](https://github.com/p-barrantes/PR01-project-python/projects/1) and the .gitignore file
2. Thinking on the necessary steps to build the game
3. Designing the game structure using the Github project
4. Creating 2 files containing the words list based on the difficulty level on one side, and the hangman images on the other
5. Coding, coding, coding
6. Testing, testing, testing
7. Fixing errors
8. Getting stressed
9. Oh! It works now
10. Updating this "README" file
11. Celebrating!

## Organization
**How did you organize your work? Did you use any tools like a trello or kanban board?**

As I'm used to work with Trello, I wanted to try the Github projects board. It's pretty much the same, but it keeps everything in just one place, which is always better. This way, the relevant files are not spread all over the internet. 

One of the things that I'm missing compared to Trello, though, is that I cannot add a description or checklist to each specific note.

**What does your repository look like? Explain your folder and file structure.**
1. As the first view, we can find the "README" file and the "game" folder.
2. This folder contains:
- `hangman.ipynb`: a Jupyter Notebook with all the code
- `images.py`: a Python file with the hangman illustrations depending on the remanining lifes
- `words.py`: a Python file with 3 words lists, one for each difficulty level

Links to the repository and the project can be found below. I haven't added any slides as I don't have to present it.
